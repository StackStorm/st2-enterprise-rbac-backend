# NOTE: We don't uninstall package on upgrade because during upgrade script
# ordering is as follows
#  %pre of new package
# (package install)
# %post of new package
# %preun of old package
# (removal of old package)
# %postun of old package
# This means that postun from the old package would remove files from new
# package because postun of old package runs after %post of new package
#if [ $1 -eq 1 ]; then
